# BioSite-DockerLB

**BioSite-DockerLB** is a fully automated, containerized deployment of a personal bio website using **Docker** on **AWS EC2 instances**, fronted by an **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)**. This project demonstrates a professional approach to cloud infrastructure, automation, and secure deployment.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project automates the deployment of a personal bio website on multiple EC2 instances to achieve:

- **High availability**: Traffic is balanced across multiple servers.
- **Security**: EC2 instances are not directly exposed to the Internet; only the Load Balancer is public.
- **Scalability**: Docker containers can easily scale horizontally.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Provisioning with Terraform ensures reproducibility.
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible automates application setup, updates, and Docker deployment.

This setup is ideal for personal projects, portfolio demonstrations, or small-scale production deployments.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Automated EC2 provisioning via **Terraform**
- Ansible-driven configuration and deployment of Docker containers
- Application deployed inside Docker for portability and ease of scaling
- AWS Load Balancer for distributing traffic securely across multiple instances
- Publicly accessible bio site URL via Load Balancer
- Infrastructure and deployment fully automated with minimal manual intervention

## ⚙️ Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to replicate the deployment:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/BioSite-DockerLB.git
cd BioSite-DockerLB
```

### 2. Provision Infrastructure with Terraform

```bash
terraform init       # Initialize Terraform
terraform apply -auto-approve  # Apply configuration and create EC2 instances
```

* Terraform will automatically create EC2 instances and generate an **Ansible inventory file** with the instances’ public IP addresses.

### 3. Deploy the Website Using Ansible

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
```

* Ansible connects to EC2 instances via SSH, installs Docker and Git, clones your bio website repository, and deploys it inside a Docker container.

### 4. Access the Website

* Open your **AWS Load Balancer URL** in a browser.
* The Load Balancer securely routes traffic to healthy EC2 instances hosting your Docker container.

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

* **EC2 Instances** are private; they do not accept public traffic directly.
* **SSH Key Management**: Access is controlled using private key files managed via Ansible.
* **Load Balancer** ensures secure distribution and avoids exposing multiple instances to the Internet.

---

## 📈 Benefits & Professional Significance

* Demonstrates **DevOps skills**: combining Terraform, Ansible, Docker, and AWS.
* Shows understanding of **secure cloud architecture** and **IaC principles**.
* Provides a real-world portfolio example: deploying a live website with automation and scalability.
